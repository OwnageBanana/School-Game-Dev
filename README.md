## Lone Survivor
This is a small game that I made in 2019 in the period of 3 weeks as part of the curriculum of a game development course taken though Athebasca University. I've created this repository as a reminder of the work and for myself and other to learn from it.

The game is mostly built in JS using Phaser.JS with a small amount of php, html, css. It requires a small MySql database to track the highscores. Included in the files is a database generation script that creates and seeds the highscore table.
additionally, there are PDF Documents that were part of the course work, including a game design document, Admin document and developer document. all of which can help with the setup and understanding of the game.
